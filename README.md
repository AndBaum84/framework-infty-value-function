# framework-infty-value-function
In the work at hand a numerical framework is established which can be applied to
investigate the dynamic, capital-theoretic model evolved by Board and ter Vehn
(2013). Solving the problem of the computation of the innite-horizon value functions, coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, are treated to build systems
of linear equations under optimal control. The resulting value-curves are approximated by Chebyshev-polynomials to receive a useful form of the value functions
for further analysis. In combination with the denition of an equilibrium in the
model, Newton's method in combination with the bisection-method are adopted
to nd an optimal value. This procedure is applied to dierent system-settings to
evaluate potential boundaries of the model.
