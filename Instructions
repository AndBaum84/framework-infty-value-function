Instructions of using the Matlab code for the Paper: An Investigation of "Reputation for Quality": A numerical framework

1) Routine.m the main schript is 
	- That scribt will execute the Algorithm 5 described in the paper
	- All generated data, hence candidates and equilibrium cutoff-values are written into matrices
	- Furthermore, the corresponding Chebyshev-approximation errors, information about the monotonicity and system-parameters are saved as well during the routine

2) plotvaluecurves.m
	- Plots the value curves according to a cutoff-value and system-parameters that has to be prespecified.

3) printcandidates.m, printoptimumcflex.m, printoptimumrflex.m, printvalueofqualigrid.m
	- pot different graphics with output from Routine.m
